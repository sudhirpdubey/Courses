```bash
npm install -g @quasar/cli
```

2. **Create the Quasar project:**

Follow the prompts to set up your project.

3. **Develop the dashboard:**

4. **Integrate real-time data:**

- Use `socket.io` or REST APIs to fetch metrics like course completions, quiz performance, and social media engagement.
- Customize the UI components to display charts, tables, and notifications.
